        <h2>What is the H-2A Visa Program?</h2>
        <p>
            The H-2A program allows U.S. agricultural employers to bring foreign nationals to the U.S. 
            for seasonal or temporary agricultural jobs. This program ensures farmers and businesses 
            have the workforce they need while protecting workers’ rights and maintaining compliance 
            with federal law.

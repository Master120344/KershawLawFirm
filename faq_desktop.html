                    <!-- FAQ Item 1 -->
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3 class="faq-question">What are H-2A and H-2B visas?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>These visas allow U.S. employers to hire foreign nationals for temporary jobs. The <strong>H-2A visa</strong> is specifically for temporary or seasonal <strong>agricultural work</strong> (like farming, livestock care). The <strong>H-2B visa</strong> is for temporary <strong>non-agricultural work</strong> (common in landscaping, hospitality, construction, forestry, etc.). Both require proving a shortage of available U.S. workers and that hiring foreign workers won't negatively impact the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers.</p>

                    <!-- FAQ Item 2 -->
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3 class="faq-question">Who is eligible to hire H-2A workers?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>U.S. employers offering temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs can petition for H-2A workers. You must demonstrate:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The job is temporary or seasonal in nature.</li>
                                <li>There aren't enough qualified U.S. workers available.</li>
                                <li>Employing H-2A workers won't adversely affect similarly employed U.S. workers.</li>
                                <li>You've met specific recruitment, wage, housing, and transportation requirements set by the Department of Labor (DOL).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <!-- FAQ Item 3 -->
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3 class="faq-question">What about H-2B: eligibility and the annual cap?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Employers needing temporary non-agricultural workers can use the H-2B program if they meet similar criteria: temporary need (like a peak season, one-time occurrence), insufficient U.S. workers, and no adverse effect. A major challenge is the <strong>annual numerical cap</strong> set by Congress (currently 66,000 per fiscal year, split semi-annually). Demand often exceeds supply, leading to a lottery system. Supplemental visas are sometimes released, but planning and timely filing are critical. Our firm helps clients navigate this complex process, including strategies to manage cap limitations.</p>

                     <!-- FAQ Item 4 -->
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3 class="faq-question">What's the typical timeline for the H-2 visa process?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>The process involves multiple steps with the DOL and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), plus consular processing abroad. It's crucial to start early! A general timeline is often <strong>75 to 120 days</strong> before the worker's start date, but this can vary. Key stages include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Prevailing Wage Determination (PWD) filing.</li>
                                <li>Advertising and recruitment of U.S. workers.</li>
                                <li>Filing the temporary labor certification (ETA Form 9142A/B) with DOL.</li>
                                <li>Filing the Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129) with USCIS.</li>
                                <li>Consular processing for workers abroad.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                         <h3 class="faq-question">What costs are involved for the employer?</h3>
                         <div class="faq-answer">
                             <p>Employers are responsible for various costs, which can include:</p>
                             <ul>
                                 <li><strong>Government Filing Fees:</strong> USCIS I-129 petition fee, potentially Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee, and the new Asylum Program Fee (check current USCIS fee schedule). Premium Processing is optional for faster USCIS adjudication at an additional cost.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Recruitment Costs:</strong> Advertising expenses for U.S. worker recruitment as required by DOL.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Legal Fees:</strong> Fees for representation, like our competitive flat fee of $3,800 per application (plus specific additions like the SEA lobbying fee and FedEx charges, as outlined in our retainer).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Worker Costs (Employer Paid):</strong> Transportation to/from the home country, daily subsistence during travel, visa processing fees (for H-2A, often H-2B too), and housing for H-2A workers.</li>
                             </ul>
                             <p>We provide a clear breakdown of anticipated costs during our initial consultation.</p>

                    <!-- FAQ Item 6 -->
                    <div class="faq-item">
                         <h3 class="faq-question">How long can H-2 workers stay, and can they extend?</h3>
                         <div class="faq-answer">
                             <p>The initial visa duration matches the employer's certified temporary need, typically up to one year. Extensions are possible in increments, generally up to a maximum continuous stay of <strong>three years</strong>. A new petition and labor certification demonstrating the continued temporary need are required for extensions. After a three-year stay, workers usually must depart the U.S. for a period before being eligible for H-2 status again. We handle extensions meticulously to maintain workforce continuity.</p>
